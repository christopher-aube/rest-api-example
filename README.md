# REST API Example

This repo shows how to create a server with a basic REST API and a frontend app to consume it.

## Notable Tech

#### [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - dependency management

#### [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - build tool

#### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - code quality

#### [React](https://reactjs.org/) - functional UI components

## Getting Started

Before you can run you'll need to install some dependencies `yarn install`.

After that completes, you can start the app and server with `yarn start`.

Alternatively, you can just start the server with `yarn start:server`.

## Server

The server provides a rest interface at `/api/v1`.

### Employee Entity

#### Schema

```javascript
{
  employeeId: string, // uuid
  email: string,
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  department: string,
  salary: number,
  status: string,
  createdAt: string, // ISO datetime
}
```

#### Endpoints

`GET` `/employees` - returns a list of all employees

`GET` `/employees/:id` - returns a single employee entity (if found)

`POST` `/employees/create` - creates a new employee

All fields in the schema are required, with exceptions to employeeId and createdAt (these fields are generated by the server).

`POST` `/employees/search` - allows you to search employees

You must pass the following data object with your search:

```javascript
{
  search: { // each of the following is optional
    firstName: string,
    lastName: string,
    department: string,
    status: string,
  },
  sort: [], // Array<string> - can be any field from the schema,
  // employeeId and anything not recognized will be ignored.
  // defaults to firstName and lastName
}
```

If no search fields have a value, then the entire list will be returned.

## Application

The app has two pages, an employee directory `/employees` and a employee profile `/employees/:id`.

The directory displays a list of employees and has a panel enabling you to interact with the employee rest api.
